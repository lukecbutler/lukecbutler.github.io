        Reflection paper - barrowkaddy
In today's society, wellness is harder than ever. In the past, people had meaning in life and well-being by direct connections with their communities and surroundings. But in this modern society,  technology have changed how we view life. Big companies now determine time and what it means to be well. Governments, industries, and artificial intelligence influence how we live, often resulting in people feeling disconnected from themselves and others. 
These ideas are related to what we've read about modernity and well-being. In "What is Modernity a Case of?" we read that modern systems have caused people to feel disconnected from their own senses of place and time. Instead of creating meaning via personal experiences, people today are in a world shaped by institutions and technologies. In "Existence Hacked," we looked at how AI is changing our perceptions of human emotions, relationships, and even death. Both readings show how modern existence is affected by artificial systems, making it more difficult to discover profound, personal meaning in a world that frequently feels dominated by forces beyond our comprehension. Humans have worked together for centuries to create communities, share thoughts, and solve issues. In the past, small communities had their own traditions, rules, and ideals. Many aspects of life are now under the supervision of much bigger systems such as governments, schools, and businesses. These systems have become so large that they no longer accurately represent individual human needs. Instead, they operate under laws and institutions that are beyond any individual's control. This shift makes it harder for people to feel fully connected to the systems in which they live.
Information alone has no use. It becomes knowledge when put into a certain context.  Technology increasingly create meaning for us, often in ways we don't completely understand. This change makes it more difficult for people to form their own knowledge of the world, increasing their dependence on other sources of information. The human body has become a political project, created by systems that determine how people live, work, and reproduce. Historically, patriarchal civilizations have regulated reproduction, restricting women's authority over their own bodies. In the modern day, institutions continue to impact people's lives through legislation, healthcare systems, and even technology. Artificial intelligence is becoming a tool in this process, impacting choices regarding life, freedom, and even death. 
After calls from every area of the social sciences to develop a broad, critical approach to human nature and technology (Crawford 2021; Harari 2017; Rushkoff 2019), the Human Versus Artificial Intelligence (HVA) Research Lab launched in January 2024 to assess the social structures that would enable the widespread development of large language, machine learning technologies. Why did these technologies suddenly appear everywhere? Put another way, why do so many companies, governments, businesses, and ordinary individuals have such similar technology requirements? The HVA Research Lab explored the history of institutions that influenced human relationships and technology. it’s been discovered that colonization contributed to the expansion of bureaucratic authority over time and place, which influenced current AI's ability to gather and exploit data. As AI advances, it supports existing power systems, which could worsen inequalities. AI-powered healthcare systems, for example, may favor particular populations above others, but AI-generated information has the potential to change how individuals see reality. This emphasizes the need of questioning who controls AI and how it influences human decision-making.
Finally, The current challenge to wellness is more than simply physical health; it is also about meaning, connection, and control. As technology and institutions develop, people must discover methods to improve their own sense of well-being. This might include concentrating more on human connections, challenging AI's place in society, or finding real ways to engage with the environment. While modern technologies complicate life, they do not have to define the entire experience. By being conscious of these problems, we may take little efforts toward finding purpose in our own lives.

        Artificial Intelligence and the Disintegration of True Human Interactions - Katie Capuano
	Artificial intelligence has quickly developed the power and ability to shape meaning within human lives. It effectively diminishes organic social interactions, changes the way communities form and grow, and synthetizes the concepts of language and culture that worked to craft what it means to be human (Andreescu, 2024). As we have entered the revolution of information and technology, our sense of culture has begun to decline, while major industries continue to grow, now with the use of synthetic complexes. The idea of something being artificial refers to humans creating something, as opposed to it developing naturally. Intelligence is the ability to learn and understand. When combined, machines gain ability to replicate human behavior, which can then lead to the adoption of human nature. This has been displayed through everyday activities that inherently promote capitalistic ideologies, produce the human body through, for, and by institutional prerogative, and how the sociology of wellness will ultimately be affected by this. 
Compromised Social Interactions
	Symbolic interactionism is a social theory promoting the idea that society is both created and maintained by interactions between individuals (Carter, M., J., & Fuller, C, 2015). If such interactions are to decline, people may start to fall into an ontological disorientation, which in turn can lead to society suffering a social trauma. A revolution led by artificial intelligence has the power to very quickly destabilize every aspect of our social structure. Humans can store information and form thoughts outside of what a computer thinks. Large language models, however, cannot do this, and often find incorrect or irrelevant material regarding the question posed. Although both computers and humans are considered intelligent, what makes someone human is clearly defined and is out of reach for large language models, at least for now. 
This has already begun to occur, as seen through popular social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok. These applications are run by algorithms that put out media and news that they think its consumers will enjoy or learn from. Algorithms are an important aspect of large language models. They are inputted into the computer performing artificially intelligent tasks. Projections for the future of artificial intelligence allude to the idea that organic constructs are soon to be “old news” (Elliot, 2023). Essentially, rather than following traditional forms of interaction like storytelling, humans can now have a computer sort through influential photos and videos as a form of global mass-communication. 
Institutional Privileges
	Society is intrinsically classist. Marxist theories suggest that capitalism will be the downfall of all of us, as it continues to drive members of the working and upper classes apart, showcasing privileges at both micro and macro levels. We have gotten to the point in time where the wellness industry has been capitalized and many working-class citizens cannot afford to “be well,” in purchasing whole foods, finding time to exercise, and even sleep well. Artificial intelligence doesn’t have to worry about things like this, as wellness is an organic, human-developed construct. However, people are being conditioned to turn to these large language models for help by using artificially developed therapy practices or counselors and thanabots that can impersonate a deceased loved one to aid within the natural process of grief (Andreescu, 2024). 
	As referenced in “Existence Hacked,” members of the top one percent of the socioeconomic pyramid are already planning for a technological apocalypse, despite their efforts to bring about these advancements in technology to the public (Andreescu, 2024). Institutionally, these privileges are created by capitalistic ideologies that society holds where billionaires can escape the chaos they have themselves created, while the rest of society suffers at the hands of these large language models. Projections assume that average members of society will soon lose the choice to escape large language models, the newest emergence of modernity (Elliot, 2023). Our bodies were created not just biologically, but with social and political forces in mind. This is a relatively recent concept within society, as philosophers developed these social theories over the course of the 20th century, and people have been building on these influential ideas ever since. Social institutions of the family, education, religion, government, and economy work to organize social life, but as technology has advanced and modernity has come about, these systems that were created organically have since taken over our lives synthetically. 
Compromised Wellness Practices
	Wellness as a study refers to being in good health and taking care of oneself, usually to accomplish a goal. As referenced earlier, when unachievable methods are brought into society, such as receiving therapy from an artificially created chatbot, the dimension of wellness can quickly become compromised. This creates yet another structure of inequality within society, as those who have the means to attain higher-end therapy with an actual counselor or psychologist will generally receive a better experience, while those who only have the time and money to receive therapy practices from a large language model will only receive answers that one could find in a simple google search. Although arguments have been made that the lack of judgement from a chatbot can be beneficial in therapy, it also lacks human qualities like empathy and compassion. The simplicity of synthetic materials as such can go over our heads, until it is starting to replicate and replace every discipline known to humankind. Synthetic materials on Earth started to exceed organic materials in 2020, further compromising major social and political concepts in the modern world, showing that this is more than possible (HVA Executive Summary). 
Conclusion
	If the domain of social sciences cannot answer the questions presented about the synthetic construct of artificial intelligence, the best we can do is educate ourselves and others about the cost-benefit analysis that large language models provide. This includes being skeptical of every answer generated, even if it’s a response to the simplest of questions. Artificial intelligence should be used as a tool, a resource, rather than a system carrying a sense of agentic capacity. Large language models do not have the ability to form their own thoughts, however, it is very possible, and we should all remain worried for an imminent revolution.

        Dylan Citta
        The human experience in many situations has always been affected by institutions, either educational, healthcare, technology, or legal. These systems have been in place for hundreds of years and create a more efficient society that can operate more smoothly to allow for more innovations. In many ways, the human body is not just the property of the human itself but rather a political project that is greatly influenced by what large corporations, scientists, and legal organizations decide what is “ideal” or “most efficient.” This module explores the way that institutions modify the human body, along with how artificial intelligence (AI) is creating a new layer to this process. This new technology can define what intelligence is while also changing the way that we see human nature. These innovations, combined with how they even impact decisions about health and well-being, have many positives and negatives on how they can impact society. If the social sciences can’t fully answer these questions, then society must figure out how to control AI’s influence before it starts controlling a large portion of the population. 
        One way institutions shape the human body is by considering the options and deciding what is considered to be valuable or acceptable in the eyes of society. In Andreescu's “Existence Hacked,” she does a great job of explaining how modern society has slowly developed a system of institutions where individuals are expected to modify their behavior, habits, and values to fit into the expectations that are set by society. An example of this would be high school students who are all trying to get into a very prestigious college, joining several clubs, and trying to maintain a perfect grade point average. Other common examples of this would be fitness tracking, cosmetic surgery, or even substances such as Adderall in the workplace that enhance the performance of the individuals who take it. These changes are not always what the individuals truly wish to partake in but through the mass influence of different governments and institutions, people are pressured into conforming with the rest of society with promises of success and freedom if they do what is expected of them. This is an interesting dynamic as more and more people are going to be willing to conform as technology further improves and people will begin to go to more extreme lengths just for society to “accept” them. An example of this would be people modifying images of themselves on social media in hopes of attracting certain people and coming across as being attractive. This form of modification has been around since the inception of social media but has only become more and more popular as people are hyper-competitive. People want to come across as the best version of themselves even if they are not manipulating the images or videos, they will only post the highlights of their life instead of what reality looks like. 
        Dr. Shane Elliot’s “A Line in the Sand” does a great job of explaining how artificial intelligence is changing how people think about knowledge and what it means to be human and intelligent. From my understanding, I took away that AI can create content and learn much faster than humans, which made me reflect on what makes human intelligence so unique. The more that society relies on AI to make work more efficient and productive, the more that society will slowly start to question what makes humans so special and capable of difficult tasks. Certain institutions control how we value ourselves, and if the dependency on artificial intelligence becomes too much, then people may feel pressured not to fight against it taking over. Critical thinking could be threatened if this trend continues, especially in the education system, as students will rely less on their critical thinking skills and more on the assistance of artificial intelligence to complete more complicated tasks. 
        Artificial intelligence also greatly affects health decisions as Derne argues in “The Sociology of Well-Being,” well-being is more so about how society defines the term rather than being about heath. AI is currently used in hospitals to diagnose specific illnesses and suggest different treatments for issues that people are running into. Although this new technology is very innovative and helpful, it is also built by institutions that decide what “healthy” is. This can lead to issues down the road, as it could deny care to certain groups or push treatments for more profit rather than caring about the well-being of the person suffering. This raises the question of what group is held responsible for who controls artificial intelligence and decides what is best for humanity, which is slowly being consumed by it. To limit the power of artificial intelligence, society needs much stronger regulation, responsible use of technology, and much better courses and educational platforms that revolve around the use of AI. Without close surveillance of how AI is used, we risk losing what makes us human, and I would argue that although it has its strengths, AI should serve humanity and not replace it.

        AI and Humanitys Role in the Modern Era - Zena Herring
Thousands of years ago, dating back to the years before America was colonized, people used to create meaning from interactions with each other. In an organic way, humans' reality was simply to live and adapt to their environment through pre-modern agency. There were no complicated macro structures that detached people and placed them into an unclear synthetic system. With my understanding of module one’s lectures and readings, I will explain the human body’s functions as a political project in institutions, how AI plays a role in shaping these processes, and lastly how we can control AI influences in society. 
The human body belongs to part of a larger more complex system of which we are trapped. The HVA Executive Summary explains the role of macro agents in our society as something that seeks to replace how humans used to interact organically. Now in a time where macro agents, such as bureaucracies, exist humans have vast identities (race, consumer, worker, student, citizen, etc.) within this system with very little control over it. There are three statements I will address in this paragraph beginning with (1), The human body is a political project produced through institutional prerogative. Taken literally, we are born into this vast system of institutions and cannot stray away from politics. The political project is nothing if it doesn’t have control over its institutions which help regulate people. (2) The human body is a political project produced for institutional prerogative. For this statement, I can only think of abortion laws. With abortions banned across the country, it forces women to give birth to children in situations where that may not be the best option for them. In this scenario, whatever the context may be surrounding the pregnancy, the baby once conceived has already become a part of the political project which controls the mother into growing that baby and birthing it. There is an institutional prerogative to dictate whether a woman could terminate a pregnancy and thus a baby could be produced for that very system. (3) The human body is a political project produced by institutional prerogative. Referring to the last two statements, these answers could be combined to understand how we are produced by these systems.  
Modernity has provided AI through many technological advancements over time. It shapes this process of depriving humans of control by giving us the agency to have a subservient piece of tech that can speak back to us through language in addition to many more things. Dr. Florentina Andreescu’s Existence Hacked: meaning, freedom, death, and intimacy in the age of AI explains AI’s agentic capacity very well. And when we envision the ways AI can use language as a synthetic form to speak with us it, just as Andreescu says, “joined humans in the production of meaning” (Andreescu, 2024). What this means is that through the effects of modernization and creating bureaucracies and institutions we now deal with AI which can isolate of from each other and even shift our perception of reality. According to the lecture The Modern Challenges to Wellness Knowledge, humans used to construct the meaning of the world through interaction, and our understanding of the external world shapes what we do with our bodies (Elliot, 2025). Something artificial cannot be capable of doing this, which is how I differentiate between AI and humans. AI uses data to depict and cater to our needs. Humans need context which determines the meaning of the information we learn. And we have human core values that AI does not, such as the ones mentioned by Dr. Florentina Andreescu. Intelligence is simply the way of which we gather, use, and apply the knowledge we learn. It can be artificial and quantified, or it can be natural and account for more nuances surrounding the context of situations, emotions, and consciousness. Human nature is a collective meaning applied to our feelings, behaviors, and values, which is essentially what makes us human. AI will never be human, but it has ways of disconnecting us from the characteristics that bridge us to creating human nature.
It is possible to control the influence of AI if humans can understand how to use it and perceive it in ways that don’t rupture our society. AI is not “smarter” simply because it is efficient in the speed at which it produces the content we desire. AI is a tool for humans to utilize and not a superintelligent being to be perceived as a co-worker or friend. It is not something that people should form relationships with because it is a piece of tech owned by big corporations that store the information you give it. It should not receive trust because it is capable of being wrong. AI has access to an incomprehensible amount of information, but it does not learn the same way humans do. Humans learn through the context of the information they are given or else it doesn’t mean anything. AI does not think this way therefore it cannot be relied upon for human cognitive abilities. To control its influences people must not only be critical of it but also not completely reliant on it. It should be used as a tool, but it should not be robbed of everything it offers to us because it is a digital poison to humanity. 
We live in a world where AI is not going away but becoming more apparent and more available. It is taking jobs, doing homework, attempting to provide relationships with people, and more, but it also seeks to control us. AI can encourage us to buy more things while shopping online or tell us it will always be right there for every beg and call. Humans should reflect on how abnormal and unhealthy this can be as AI intends to isolate us enough to shift our reality into being nothing without its existence and help. The effects AI has on us now and in the future may not be reversible, but it can be mitigated through proper adaptation techniques that bring humans closer together and not further apart.

        What AI Means for Human Knowledge - Avery Hiller
        Artificial Intelligence or “AI” is a type of technology that uses data from across the internet in order to answer questions and solve problems quickly and efficiently. Rather than you looking across multiple websites or resources, AI takes information from all publicly accessible domains and uses that information to summarize a response to any questions you may have. Intelligence is the ability to understand information and apply that understanding to different disciplines. Artificial intelligence is referred to as “artificial” due to its lack of understanding information, but rather just regurgitating it in an easily digestible way through the different algorithms attached to it. AI has been advancing, and this advancement has caused much --- due to what it means for society. Because of the accessibility of solutions and information that AI grants us, we rely on it to solve issues we would have had to work towards previously. 
        Artificial Intelligence has decreased the frequency at which we interact with our own minds and other humans. Instead of asking people around you how something works or having a person explain something to you, we reach for some form of AI to feed us the answers. By asking technology how something works rather than asking people, we veto the experience of being able to understand other people’s perspectives or opinions on things. Understanding what people feel about certain topics helps us be more accepting of people who are different than us because we are gaining an insight to their experience and outlooks. When referring to the answers AI provides us, I refuse to use the word “knowledge”. This is because AI does not give us knowledge, it gives us answers. We can turn the answers received by AI into knowledge, but it is not knowledge unless we actively try to understand and learn through the answers provided to us. This one of the many ways AI can be harmful to society. Using AI as a tool to copy and paste answers from prevents us from learning anything and still benefitting as if we truly held the knowledge required to solve the problem or answer the question. 
        Human productivity is threatened by AI due to its accessibility and immediate gratification. If we have a tough problem to solve and use AI to provide us with a solution, we are not only rejecting our own ability to solve the problem, but we are also allowing ourselves to become accustomed to instant gratification. Since the beginning of time, we have used our own cognitive abilities to find solutions to problems and search for our own answers, but, as mentioned in “What is Modernity a Case of” by Shane Elliott, AI invites a whole list of problems for our own intelligence. Elliott says, “While humans developed the ability to be contingent open systems with the development of language, Modernity creates a radically different situation—one that our limited cognitive abilities make us vulnerable to… The earth is being consumed by the logics of machines that do not perceive or exist in any organic environment that would be recognizable to human consciousness.” Humans have accepted help from technology that does not understand what it is like to be human, which has caused us to lose signt of what it means to be human. 
        In “Existence Hacked: Meaning, Freedom, Death, and Intimacy in the Age of AI” by Florentina Andreescu, the concept of humans accepting AI as a “creator” is discussed. Accepting AI as a creator means we allow AI to create a human narrative, for example, when we ask AI about a historical event, it feeds us facts about how the event took place, without any regard for possible destruction or wrongdoing, and on top of that, it is highly unlikely that we question any of the information it tells us. Andreescu acknowledges this imbalance of power when she writes, “The ability to understand and generate meaning is fundamental to human civilization. For this reason, we need to be especially vigilant of AI’s interference in our relationship with language. Here, it is important to highlight that, at a time when algorithmic systems had already infltrated and restructured a large part of the social, cultural, and economic domains, AI technology asserted itself most powerfully in our collective consciousness, when ChatGPT acquired the ability to engage humans via language. ChatGPT, followed by the release of a surfeit of other language models, joined humans in the production of meaning.” It is important we take what AI feeds us with the understanding that it may not be correct, and it is definitely lacking the humanity sometimes required to fully understand a concept. 
        We accept AI as a creator of solutions, and also a co-creator of our current reality. Not only do we let AI sit at the table next to us when we are looking for answers, we sometimes look to it to feed us answers. Rather than using AI as a tool for understanding a concept, we tend to allow AI to use us as a tool to strengthen its algorithm and to use us as its mouthpiece. This causes us to accept the reality AI writes for us with it as a part of society. In “Grid-Iron Ground” by Shane Elliott, he writes “We identify with the experience through imagination, and our brains send emotive signals along the neural paths built for collectively signifying the meaning of reality—or domains made legible by the bodies’ physical tools gathering information about environments external to the body.” If our experiences continue to involve AI, AI will become a part of our reality with a regard it does not deserve. 
        Artificial Intelligence should be used as a tool for us to access the information we need to educate ourselves, not as a teacher or all-knowing being. We should not see the answers AI gives us and take it at face-value, we should always check behind it and regard it as a means for further knowledge, not as a means to an end. When it comes to the accessibility of AI, we need to understand how it works and that it is not all-knowing, and we should not compare our own intelligence to the intelligence of the technology. Humans have so many characteristics that separate us from Artificial Intelligence and if we start to lose those characteristics (love, empathy, morals, etc.) due to our interactions with AI, the separation between us and AI gets narrower and narrower.

        The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Restructuring Human Existence - Holly Patterson
        Humanity as a whole is embedded within institutional structures that serve as an ongoing political reign of influence. In the case of modernity, the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) has reinforced and expanded control over the human body, serving as an extension of institutional authority. With this new technology governing the daily life of society, it warrants an examination of the institutionalization of humanity being amplified by AI and a discussion of proper mitigating factors.
Institutionalization of the Human Body
	The human body is no longer defined as solely a biological being but rather an ongoing political project influenced by institutional powers that govern its very existence in society. Historically, humans relied on their own logic of understanding based on time and space, but now intelligence is crafted by the prerogative of institutions. As Elliott (2023) describes, humanity no longer places reliance on human logic but rather is conditioned through non-human entities that enact logic against externally defined symbolic intersubjective reality. Bureaucratic hegemonic ideologies and societal norms are ingrained in the very meaning of what being a human entails. 
	This power structure is equipped to influence the human body in a multitude of ways, including the very ways in which meaning is defined and understood. Institutional powers are not limited to traditional structures but also encompass factors in the technology realm that amplify the impact of existential meaning. Due to this, society is going through an abrupt change with impacts including the destabilization and reshaping of knowledge, communication, and power (Andreescu, 2023).
Amplification of Artificial Intelligence
	Understanding how AI shapes the human body as a political project produced by institutional authority is to understand the defining factors of artificiality, intelligence, and human nature. For something to be defined as artificial, it is considered to be not naturally occurring or, in other words, inorganic. Intelligence can be described as the meaning of space and time and a tool for the collection and utilization of information concerning the environment (Elliott, 2023). Defining human nature is complex and is comprised of naturally occurring characteristics and dispositions, sometimes referred to as the meaning of human existence. 
	The Peace of Westphalia treaties in 1648 were the starting point of AI conceptualization and communication by way of synthetic syntax production through bureaucratic entities (Human Versus Artificial Intelligence Research Lab, 2024). This led to a shift in how humans construct meaning of the world, going from interaction to the overall progression of institutional structures shaping space, surpassing the agency of humans to shape the meaning of institutions (Elliott, 2025). With a lack of agency comes vulnerabilities that are then preyed upon by artificial intelligence technologies that amplify pre-existing political and social agendas. Due to this, the perception of well-being is being influenced by societal structures rather than human nature, leading to a collapse of the culture and subjectivity of human existence (Derne, 2016).
Controlling the Influence
	AI’s role in amplifying institutional control over humanity needs to be mitigated by utilizing an interdisciplinary approach. AI governance would benefit from the intersection of policy, humanities, and technology fields. This conglomeration of professionals could approach the task of regulating AI from a nuanced standpoint and work together to implement policies to control the influence AI has on society. Additionally, an individual-based anecdote to AI’s exacerbation of institutional agency is to practice literacy skills when utilizing this technology as a tool. Further interdisciplinary research exploring the impact of AI and the resulting societal changes will foster discussions publicly and academically (Andreescu, 2024).
Conclusion
	Approaching this topic through the sociological perspective allows for input on how AI is restructuring human existence. With the emergence of AI technologies, institutional prerogatives are now being amplified through the alteration of human existence. The human body is equivalent to the outcome of whatever has the agency to alter its conceptualization of space external to its mind (Elliott, 2025). Artificial intelligence is creating a false reality of human existence, all while being powered by the hegemonic ideologies that make up the institutional structures that have influenced humanity for centuries. To combat the influence AI has on society, interdisciplinary work will be needed to further measure the impacts this technology has on human existence and call for the implementation of regulatory policies.

        Artificial Intelligence Lessens the Demand for Ontological Human Processes - Meryl Sloan
Throughout the class readings, there has been a discussion of the relation between human processes and the intertwine of artificial intelligence and practice of modernity. With new technology increasing, the ways in which humans interact and create their institutions has been shaped into new ways. The ways in which the human experience is characterized has been shifted through many different processes. 
	The human body and the behaviors, feelings, and emotions it produces has become shifted and shaped because of increasing technologies. With the increasing aspects of modernity and technologies that have been produced as a result, the synthetic processes that have emerged, affects the socialization and behavioral process that humans have had in the past. Initially, language and interaction amongst humans was the process taken to give meaning to the ideas and knowledge that humans had (Dr. Elliot, Lecture, 2025). The ontological processes that humans participate in categorizes the human behavior that the emergence of modernity clouds. The conscious processes that humans use to construct the social concepts within their lives becomes intertwined with the synthetic processing that technology offers. This intertwine can lead to a sense of dissonance between this sort of human function, resulting in synthetic processes of thinking becoming more prevalent than authentic human thought. With synthetic process beginning to replace authentic human processing through interaction and language, this is where humans are becoming political projects for institutions. The ontological dissonance created by the emersion of synthetic processes and technologies such as artificial intelligence, creates a gap between authentic decision making and obedience to or submission to authority. 
	With the emersion of artificial intelligence practices, the distance between human submission/lack of control and cognitive thought becomes closer. Artificial intelligence technologies provide programs that perform the same as any authentic human could. These programs are beginning to think for people therefore eliminating the need for authentic ontological processing by humans. This disrupts the need for the ultimate form of meaning making, which is language models and interaction, for humans. This elimination of common processes leaves room for artificial intelligence to be the newer form of meaning making. Artificial intelligence can reconceptualize many important aspects of human existence. Artificial intelligence can analyze the data that human’s input into the technologies resulting in algorithms that are able to predict and act in favor of whomever has been using these technologies. These algorithms make it easier for the person using the technologies, eliminating any difficulty in obtaining the “right” information, making the sense of self in adherence to the algorithm which also therefore eliminates any chance of information that could conflict with this sense of self (Andreescu, 2024). The information that is performed through artificial intelligence technologies comes without the agency that human information has. These technologies don’t have the same cognitive abilities and behavioral processes that come with the freedoms that human agency has. Since artificial intelligence does not have a sense of agency, the information that it produces shifts society in a way that makes many things within it synthetic. The information produced is surface level in ranks of cognitively, therefore creating this sense that the cognitive abilities aren’t necessarily needed. When artificial intelligence starts to replace the cognitive human processes that were once so important within human society, the reality is shifted to the ideas that are produced synthetically. Artificial intelligence technologies begin to process things for humans, therefore lessening human’s abilities and likelihood to grasp the meaning of concepts on a deeper level (Elliot, 2023). Humans’ reliance upon artificial intelligence technologies aids in the emergence of humans as strictly political projects that adhere to institutional authorities. 
	If the social sciences can’t understand the impact of artificial intelligence on human society, then the impact of artificial intelligence practices becomes more difficult to understand. The control that artificial intelligence already has upon society is at large, so it’s important to understand the implications that this control has. If humans disregard the need for their use of cognitive reasoning, artificial intelligence will become more prevalent due to its ability to, on a lower level, imitate human ontological processes. With this replacement of human processing by artificial intelligence, society begins to become distant, with the levels of understanding of meaning and the contexts of situations having less correlation. The difficulty to keep societal ideas relevant and understood becomes prevalent in extreme lengths. Humans must not give full power to these technologies as their use cannot compare to the ontological cognitive processes that humans are able to produce.

        We have read and analyzed the existence of artificial intelligence, what it truly means, and how it has impacted human beings way of life in every aspect. Given this, it can be difficult to understand how these factors are going to affect our well-being, ability to make decisions for ourselves, and the way we view the world as the rapidly changing institutional progress around us everyday increases. In “Existence Hacked”, Dr. Andreescu dives into the concepts that AI is forever changing humans process of making meaningful connections about meaning itself, intimacy, freedom, and death. As we participate and use AI more and more, we lose our “natural” human connection to these topics, leading us to be easily manipulated by AI (Andreescu 2024).
In Dr. Elliots lecture “A Line in the Sand: How AI forces more clarity in the meaning of knowledge” as well as “What is Modernity a Case of?”, we discovered the true process and role that modernity has taken throughout the course of human life and evolution over the course of time. When discussing inorganic or artificial intelligence, we have to understand that even things such as tools, fire, shelter, language etc. are all man-made productions, not organic/come directly from the earth (Elliott 2025). As humans and modernity have grown stronger, humans have created synthetic or inorganic practices such as language, interacting with each other/tribes, and then creating information/meaning from it to transform into culture and generational knowledge. These differing languages, cultures, and religions are what have brought institutions about. In today’s society, humans are required to participate in society, culture/societal norms, capitalism, the market, consumerism, bureaucracy, and more, that we associate with normal life (Elliott 2023). These institutional macro agents occur have been built, then we have to contribute to maintain health and well-being. We have little control in our participation in them, but must to have our needs met, this is done by having a job, being able to eat, take care of ourselves, have shelter, and contribute to our happiness by having interactions and connections with others (a life partner, children, a family, etc.) (Elliott 2025).
	As we have learned in “Existence Hacked”, our ability to maintain this well-being within social connection, has been changed by A.I. severely. As a A.I. has been able to produce immediate, consistent, curated acknowledgement to us, our ability to make meaningful connections with others has been changed. Social isolation is a broad topic that has been both aided and impaired by A.I., humans for the first time ever, can “speak” to an A.I. robot, such as ChatGPT, for immediate connection to something. This connection though, creates more social isolation as we detach ourselves from actual human connection and direct it to this A.I. system. This goes against our human nature to want to connect with others in real space/life, develop meaningful relationships with others, work with others to solve problems, etc. Thus leading to changes in our way of making meaning of actual human connection and intimacy (Andreescu 2024).
	When we take a sociological perspective of these topics and how the future is dependent on these macro agents, we must question how and when we will reach a point of autopoesis, in which A.I. can run these agents on their own without our assistant (Elliott 2023). This would be the peak of human consciousness as we would no longer need to place effort and energy into things like food production, the markets, and capitalism, allowing us to have free time to do more. The only issue with reaching this point, is, how can we control the A.I. to do these things properly? What would we do without these things? Would we lose our ability to learn, communicate, and have social relationships? These are all unanswered questions we can only theorize about. When looking at these questions, it seems that A.I. poses a threat to all things we have made meaning of thus far in human progression. It also allows us to have more time to spend on things that make us happy, such as being out in nature, spending more time with our loved ones, helping others, and doing our hobbies, as we would not be fighting for survival (Derne N.D.). Another question is will the earth, all organic things, and life continue to sustain on this planet? We continue to add to pollution, global warming, and man-made products, as we do so, the planet reaps the consequences (Elliott 2025). Given this as well as the idea of autopoesis in things such as farming, will our food still hold nutritional value, be able to grow properly, or will we be eating man-made substances that allow us to live, but not enjoy (Elliott 2023)? When taking these questions upon myself, I believe that as a society, we must ask ourselves how much we are truly willing to give and take for this next level of evolution. If so, there truly is no control or return to “natural” life, there is only this idea of a completely digitalized and manufactured way of life, without nature, quality food, and overall, our well-being. 
	In module one, we have learned much about the importance of value that we place upon things and how they can have detrimental cause and effects. Consequently, as we put more time, thought, and effort into it, there seem to be equal value but costs to A.I. It is interesting to see how these new technologies and processes pose great threat to the meaning of life as we know it. As we dive more into well-being and what it truly means to be well, happy, and healthy, we must also recognize the value of having the opportunity to live in a technologically advanced society.

Artificial Intelligence and the Human Body - Jasmine Watson
Society has shaped our understanding of the human body. What is considered to be an aspect of well-being and wellness is influenced by social institutions rather than individual matters. Institutions such as the government, sports systems, and technology corporations set the rules as to how individuals should appear, behave, and think about the social world around them. They get to decide what bodies are useful, who gets resources, and even who is considered important. In contemporary society, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) makes this even more complicated. The rise of AI has given institutions control which is constantly transforming in ways that make us question what it even means to be a human. AI does not only reflect societal values but reinforces them as well. It shapes how we define and understand the terms artificial, intelligence, and human nature. This reflection explores how the human body is a political project, how AI shapes this, and the role social sciences ca play in the impact AI has on society.
From sports leagues to healthcare, institutions determine how bodies are used and valued. In “Grid-Iron Ground,” Dr. Elliott discusses how professional sports, such as the National Football League (NFL), use athlete’s bodies as commodities. Their bodies are valued because of their ability to perform and generate money for the company. In this example, it can be seen that the body becomes a political project shaped by those in power. This metaphor goes beyond sports, and the same kind of control can be seen in other ways. The Human Versus Artificial Intelligence (HVA) Executive Summary highlights how technology is used to alter human experiences and matter itself. By defining knowledge and efficiency and influencing social spaces, institutions play the role of macro actors. In this context, the human body becomes a project created by the priorities of institutions. They focus on what benefits the system rather than the individual.
AI supports and advances the control institutions have over bodies by changing what it means to be human. As Dr. Andreescu states in “Existence Hacked,” AI hacks our understanding of meaning, freedom, and even intimacy. It creates an illusion of safety and control and a world of loneliness and fake connections. It raises the questions of what is artificial, and what is intelligence. Dr. Andreescu’s article and her lecture bring up the point that if society prioritizes speed and efficiency over organic understanding because it is easier to do, then the nature of human intelligence can be disregarded. Additionally, the HVA Executive Summary discusses the concept of consciousness and includes non-human actors, which reflects the role AI has in shaping environments and meanings. This aligns with the concept of Khushhali which emphasizes well-being as a balance of inner feelings, health, and wealth. However, subjective health (how we view our own well-being) is often forgotten and neglected for quantitive ways to measure well-being. The idea that AI is more efficient and convenient may overlook the importance of relationships and activities that can improve life. As AI finds its way into daily life, there is the possibility of efficiency and data being prioritized over well-being.
To control the influence of AI, social sciences must acknowledge that there are limitations to the knowledge we certainly have. These limitations often struggle to keep up with the rapid advancements in technology. Dr. Andreescu mentions a need for interdisciplinary research, so connecting the fields of sociology, philosophy, and technology could be beneficial for fully understanding the impact AI can have on human existence. Without this approach, there is the chance for AI to keep evolving, and society will continue to value speed and effectiveness over the overall freedom and well-being of an individual. A method to handle this is to create systems that put individuals first. It focuses on the ethics and values of human life instead of just focusing on making AI faster and more powerful. Instead of trying to predict and control everything and all information, society should work on adapting and thinking critically about how AI fits into our lives. I believe people view AI as something that we should just accept as inevitable, but it needs to be intentionally designed in ways that support individuals. It needs to be used to benefit society rather than letting it control how people live.
Artificiality refers to things humans create, such as AI. It is designed to learn, understand, and solve issues in ways that resemble and enhance the way humans think. Intelligence is a combination of taking in information, adapting, and making decisions. AI is getting increasingly better at this, making us question what sets human intelligence apart from artificial intelligence. Human nature is the distinct characteristics and behaviors that define individuals and who they are. This has come out of history and culture and has been around since the early days of humans. Our lives are formed by both the social and environmental factors in society which contribute to our overall well-being. As AI continues to develop and expand, social sciences must prioritize human concerns and ethical considerations to help ensure that technology works for us, not against us.

        Artificial Intelligence’s Influence on Humans in a Political World - Jackson Williams

	Citizens of our society tend to not realize the impacts that the government and political parties have with the influence and guidance that is provided, and essentially forced, to us on an everyday basis. This is evident when examining the question posed to us regarding how the human body in our society is a political project produced for the prerogative of these political institutions. This revolves around the idea that the human body of people in our society is controlled and regulated through the political system, being heavily influenced by their decisions. These decisions that I mention include institutions within our society that are extremely important and affect our everyday wellness. Institutions like hospitals and healthcare, which have an immediate effect on our wellness and are ultimately decided upon by politics and political movement. Politics in our society is decided upon by the officials elected by the people, meaning the people decide who is put into power and creates these regulations and control that is put in place. However, the decisions that are made by people in our society are often heavily influenced by the people that hold power in our society. Meaning that it is hard for our society to progress with the wellness of our everyday people, as the votes and decisions made by these people are so heavily influenced and essentially controlled by the top percent and most powerful people in our society. Creating the concept and idea that the human body in our society is a political project produced through for, and by institutional prerogative. As this prerogative seen in our society tends to benefit the small minority of the most powerful people in our society, while the majority of people still struggle. 

	With this idea of how our human bodies are projects for the political system and prerogatory in our society, we can also see how it heavily affects our wellness. As our wellness is determined by our wellbeing in our lives, which is heavily influenced by our health and our wealth in the world. As we read about in chapter one of our assigned reading for the sociology of well being, we read many examples of people explaining how the wealth and health of an individual coincide with the overall well being of that individual. Playing very large and important roles in the overall well being and wellness of an individual. With this notion presented to us in this reading, we can also see how the political system we endure heavily affects these factors in our lives. As we are essentially controlled by the most powerful in our country, keeping the upper class minority of our population powerful, wealthy, and healthy, and in turn heightening their wellness and well being. With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence this process can be increased as well. As we discussed with our discussion and in our reading with Dr. Andreescu, we know that AI has the ability to take our data and influence our decisions. By taking our responses and the data that we provide to AI it can create more political control for people and more influence. As we also spoke on the dangers of AI, specifically the addicting and habitual nature surrounding AI. As it is very easy and tempting for a person to use Ai continuously, and as we use AI more and more it can shape and influence our thoughts and decisions. 

	Because of the changing of our society, as explained by Dr. Andreescu in her lecture to the class and in our assigned reading, changing into a new age similar to that of industrialization with the information technology change, it is not feasible to completely stop the production of AI. However, it is possible for us humans in society to better manage the dangers and temptations of AI. This could be through a process of not trusting AI so deeply, as we spoke about during our lecture. This can be an effective way to manage AI and manage the influence that it has over us. If we do not trust AI completely and rather rely on AI as a tool and not as a crutch, this influence and temptation can be better managed by our society. This can be helpful to everyone as it will create a sense of purpose for people and AI, as Ai can still be used for good reason, such as a research tool, yet not a tool that is supposed to do everything for us.

        A Shift in the Human Experience - Emma Caplan
Since bureaucracies and institutions were created, human beings were subjected
to social construction that shaped societal norms, rules, and how individuals interact in
the world. As artificial intelligence continues to grow, our agency continues to decrease
where with rapid change, humans adapt, redefining now only how humans create
meaning, but influencing our interactions with one another. According to the HVA
executive summary, as of 2020, there is more synthetic material on Earth than organic,
which goes to question the idea that humans were never meant to have this much
technology, thus rendering how humans are supposed to live. Humans produced culture
through language and storytelling, shaping meaning through experiences and fleeting
moments of wellness, however as bureaucracies grew, people started categorizing their
role in society. Institutions such as government, healthcare, education set up how we live,
through the idea that institutions are controlling spaces and categorizes in which humans
exist in, emphasizing the idea that everything we do is influenced and shaped through our
surroundings. Artificial intelligence uses data and algorithms to curate an individual's
desires, but it also significantly impacts the concept of meaning, and the consequences
that follow as more humans gain access to artificial intelligence. Humans are losing
critical thinking skills, lack of real human connection through dwindling interactions,
humans are losing jobs, and humans are losing their agency through the advancement of
AI. Social scientists have written articles and done research on the effects of artificial
intelligence but there is no controlling artificial intelligence in where it was first developed
as a tool to help certain areas of life and now it’s not only shaped how we do things such as
have it do homework for class, but it joined humans in the production of meaning in how
we understand language.
Humans need social interaction, and even with human interaction there is a loneliness
epidemic. In the “Sociology of Well Being”, research was conducted in India discussing
what wellbeing means to people, where the general conclusion was how wellbeing was
found in “felicitous chains” in which people interact with one another in mutually
supportive conversations and building genuine connections. As technology was
introduced, social interactions decreased as well as people can have the same comfort of
talking on their phone as a real human being. Studies show how suicide rates are
increasing, mental health is a crisis, and even if you are surrounded by friends and
neighbors, there is still a sense of loneliness and isolation. This is a huge result of how
individualistic humans have become, where communities are scarce, people think about
themselves, and technology and artificial intelligence creates perfectly curated personas
people would rather put out to the world, crafting these brands for themselves rather than
just live for themselves. Artificial intelligence such as Spotify, or your Instagram feed
shows you what it thinks you want to see, using data and algorithms to create an
experience that feels so real for humans emphasizing the idea that perception becomes
reality. In the article “What is Modernity a Case Of,” C.S Elliot mentions how we presume
only humans can “signify meaning” where now humans perceive life through an artificial
lens, with “institutionalized realities” altering how we interact not only with other people
but impacts how we behave in our day to day lives. People use filters, photoshop, and have
the ability to alter anything to cater to their own desires, presenting a new reality that isn’t
genuine. Technolgy modifies naturally occurring process in ways some people aren’t even
aware of, where it has become so integral in society such as calculators instead of humans
used algorithms, or ordering clothes on amazon, or door dash. Humans have gotten so
accustomed to using technology that they don’t even realize how they did things before.
Using a GPS was something introduced years ago, but what did people do before? They
had spatial awareness and used maps, however once GPS was introduced, it provided
easy access to maps right off your phone which can take you anywhere, and now some
people can’t remember to get into their own neighborhoods without it. People adapted
quickly to technology and with the development of artificial intelligence where Dr.
Andreescu in her article “Existence Hacked” reveals just how artificial intelligence shifted
from being used as a tool, to creating deepfakes, pretending you are talking to a friend or
therapist, or lectures being taught by Einstein. Society knows how to adapt to social
trauma, where if there is rapid change, naturally we will shift to whatever that change is.
Dr. Andreescu revealed how when there is a disrupted sense of security, such as the
concept of big data, humanity rearranges to adapt to these changes, which goes to show
how Artificial intelligence shifts the concept of agency. When the world was dealing with a
global pandemic, we learned to do classes on zoom and continue life with masks and
distance, and that same logic completely changed the way we saw life, thus altering the
human experience and how humans interacted with one another.
Bureaucracies and institutions directly and indirectly shape the rules, norms, and
behavior humans are subjected to, whether it’s the idea of legality, or something simple as
a university’s dress code. The environment of bureaucracies is “symbolically defined
through interactions between non-human systems” (C.S Elliot) and these institutions
create the experience of culture, by “interacting with other agents” emphasizing how
social construction shapes how nations and institutions interact with each other. Artificial
Intelligence has become so complex, the data can alter how humans see information, in
little ways such as what appears on their feed, or filtering information, creating a loss of
agency. Sociologists can discuss the impacts of what it means to be human and how
artificial intelligence plays a role in these concepts, but there is no controlling artificial
intelligence. Even if a human chooses not to ask chat GPT a question, there are several
ways they artificial intelligence plays a role in their behavior and interactions, on a micro
and macro level, and there is no controlling how far artificial intelligence can go, no matter
the social studies of consequences and effects of artificial intelligence.

        Reimagining Life and Death Through AI - Isabella Creamer
        As we have seen throughout this course so far, humans are being shaped by the
technology they are being exposed to. Along with technology, humans are being shaped by the
institutions they come into contact with. Technology itself is an institution that is changing the
ways humans interact with each other and even themselves more than ever before. The definition
of what it means to be human is ever-evolving, and in today’s society of fast paced life and
immediate gratification, technology and AI play a major role. AI is altering how we envision our
lives, as well as our death.
In “What is Modernity a Case of?” by Dr. Shane Elliott, we are faced with the question of
what modernity is made of and when exactly it was when we entered this “modern” era. As we
discovered, we entered modernity when human life started routinely interacting with
technological or digital life. Modernity as a concept sounds ideal. However, when we get into the
finer details, the lines between the positive and the negative are blurred. In “Existence Hacked”
by Dr. Florentina Andreescu, we discover a multitude of ways in which AI and advancing
technology is changing humanity, and how it is creating negative impacts on people around the
globe. It is clear that humanity was not ready for the technological advances AI has provided.
Because of this, people can develop trauma associated with this radical social change, as
Andreescu says on page 3 of her article. This trauma can occur because change is happening
faster than we can understand. Most human beings are not capable of comprehending the
large-scale impacts this technology will have on current society as well as future societies. The
main point I want to stress in this essay is the ways in which people are reimagining their living,
day-to-day lives, as well as their deaths, or the death of loved ones. A technology that is readily
available is one in which people can upload texts and emails from their deceased loved ones, and
an AI bot will use that data in order to talk as if it were that person. In essence, people can
“speak” with their deceased loved ones through this AI bot. This can lead to a feeling of
reconnection or lessened grief after a person’s passing. However, it can also lead to confusion,
especially when it comes to children. There are programs in which “deepfakes,” or AI generated
images or videos, are created depicting people and creating a sense of “digital resurrection”
(Andreescu 7). In this case, deepfakes can be made to depict people’s deceased loved ones, and
to children, this can be incredibly confusing or disturbing. Seeing the person they thought was
gone speaking to them can lead to distress, especially when they figure out that they won’t
actually be able to see this person in person ever again.
Through AI, we are also seeing a change in the way we think about our own death. With
advanced technology and AI, we can essentially “live forever,” fostering a sort of digital
resurrection (Andreescu 7). Photos, videos, and text uploaded to the Internet are available
forever, and they can be used to keep a person alive, even well after their death. This was known
well before the era of AI, but the fact that we can now use this information to create deepfakes or
digitally resurrect our loved ones is a phenomenon nobody was prepared for.
We can not control the impact or influence AI will have on our society. The general
population has no input regarding what does and doesn’t happen when it comes to the changes
being made. AI is developing far quicker than we are capable of comprehending it, and humanity
is worse off for it.

        I want to begin by saying that I think my opinions on AI have changed drastically since I
have started this class. When it first began I was incredibly excited and optimistic about AI and
was excited to see all the ways in which it has changed our society and what was next. However,
after hearing the many lectures from Prof.Elliott and guest speaker Dr.Andreescu my feelings
have changed. I think that as humans we could potentially be creating something that will
“hack”our existence
Intelligence
For a long time the social, political, and economic forces that define what it means to be
human have shaped our society. This process is an endeavor that has been influenced by laws,
technological developments, and cultural narratives and is not organic. Our basic existence is
“hacked” by the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI), not only through physical
interventions but also through digital systems that influence our day-to-day activities. AI has
completely changed our interactions, information consumption, and perception of reality. Even in
its early dev;eoplemt it has ingrained itself so throughout into our synthetic societies that we
already depend on it completely for certain aspects of our lives (GPS Example). Fundamental
questions are forced to be reexamined as the development of AI continues. Drawing on excerpts
from Steven Dernes “The Sociology of Well-Being” Dr.Shane Elliot’s works on Modernity and
AI, and Dr. Florentine Andreescu’s Existence Hacked, I will explore how AI is actively
reprogramming human existence, and not just changing our understanding of intelligence.
The Hacking of Human Existence
Historically Macro non-human actors have influenced human behavior, but artificial
intelligence has brought about a new kind of influence that is different. In “Existence Hacked”,
Dr.Andreescu examines how our further development of technology and algorithms have begun
to reshape our existence, causing us to rely on artificial intelligence, entertainment, and
economic ecosystems to survive. We now live inside AI’s existence rather than just using it as a
tool. For example our interactions are controlled by social media algorithms, our purchasing
decisions are influenced by analytics, and our understanding of our society and others existence
is altered by AI powered platforms. As AI continues to become more ingrained into our world
the questions of who has more agency must be answered.
AI’s role in Construction of Synthetic Societies
Currently the most advanced AI systems we have available are capable of generating
art,composing music, and engaging in conversation in real time with anyone, this has completely
redefined creativity. AI is actively shaping the society we live in in addition to having an impact
on our intellectual lives. Prof.Elliott challenges modernity's reliance on data and automation in
"What is modernity a case of?”, contending that AI is accelerating the transition to synthetic
societies, AI is progressively limiting human agency. AI determines the terms of our social
interactions, whether it's through a GPS to navigate cities, dating apps to build relationships, or
online discussions.
Loss of Human Experience
According to Steve Derne’s work, “The Sociology of Well-being” emphasizes how
community and meaningful interaction are essential for fulfillment. Could it be possible that with
the introduction of more AI we could begin to lose our sense of meaningful interaction, already
algorithms play a leading role in matchingaking. The HV A also highlights how AI driven
environments put interaction ahead of authenticity. A question from this that I wish I would've
had the opportunity to ask Dr.Andrescuee is “Can we still claim to be living real human lives if
AI controls our experiences”. While there are a few connections she made to address this
question it is still one I'd love to have her opinion on.
Controlling AI
Alternative approaches must be created if we are unable to understand and answer
questions regarding AI’s impact on human life. To reduce the possibility of negative effects of
AI, openness in the development, and making decisions more transparent are essential to
guarantee that AI continues to be a tool for empowerment rather than have agency over us.
Procedures for human oversight must continue to be essential to AI-driven decision making, and
policies must be created to stop AI from taking full control over our existence.
Conclusion
As humans we are socially contested and influenced by institutions rather than just
biology. This process is accelerated by AI, which becomes so ingrained within our artificial
society that it threatens to replace human agency. AI already governs a multitude of different
aspects within our lives, from how we engage with the outside world to how we define
intelligence and life in general. AI has the potential of compromising the human experience if
left unchecked. Society may take back control of defining what it means to be human in the
digital era by analyzing AI impact critically and supporting the monitoring of it. Ensuring that AI
servers humanity as a tool rather than reprogramming it fundamentally
